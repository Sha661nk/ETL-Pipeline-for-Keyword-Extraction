# ETL-Pipeline-for-Keyword-Extraction
Google Search Engine algorithms are constantly evolving to provide more accurate and relevant search results to users. As a result, they are now ranking more pages than ever before, which can make the ranking system appear less transparent. Despite this, certain factors still contribute significantly to page ranking, with keywords and page titles being among the most important.

The strategic use of relevant keywords can help improve the ranking of web pages, which in turn can increase overall business value. However, finding such keywords can be a daunting task, especially for those who are not experienced in search engine optimization (SEO) techniques.

To address this challenge, an end-to-end utility can be created that leverages cloud services to find relevant keywords for any general topic. The utility can be designed to crawl through web pages, analyze their content, and extract relevant keywords that are likely to improve the ranking of a page. This process can be automated using machine learning algorithms that can identify patterns in the content and determine which keywords are likely to be most effective.

Cloud services can provide the necessary infrastructure for running the utility, such as storage, compute power, and networking capabilities. They can also enable real-time processing of data and provide scalability to handle large volumes of data and traffic.

Once the relevant keywords are identified, they can be added to the content of the web page, including the page title and meta tags. This can improve the visibility of the page in search results and increase the likelihood that users will click on it.

Overall, the creation of an end-to-end utility leveraging cloud services to find relevant keywords for web pages can help businesses improve their online visibility and increase their overall business value. By automating the process of identifying relevant keywords and leveraging cloud infrastructure, businesses can save time and resources while improving the effectiveness of their SEO efforts.
